Selection Sort

example::
n=6
0  1   2  3  4  5
7  4  10  8  3  1

unlike Insertion Sort where the first element is considered as in sorted order, the Selection Sort considers 
the sorted as empty and the given elements are in un order.

_  _  _  | 7  4  10  8  3  1
unsorted       sorted

the logic for selection sort is swap the unsorted order first element with the minimum element, and assume it as sorted.

_  |  7  4  10  8  3  1
now swap min with first element i.e., 1 with 7
then,

pass1::  ==>> i=0
1  |  4  10  8  3  7

pass2::  ==>> i=1
now swap min with unsorted first element i.e., 3 with 4
1  3  |  10  8  4  7

pass3::  ==>> i=2
now swap min with unsorted first element i.e., 4 with 10
1  3  4  |  8  10  7

pass4::  ==>> i=3
now swap min with unsorted first element i.e., 7 with 8
1  3  4  7  |  10  8

pass5::   ==>> i=4
now swap min with unsorted first element i.e., 8 with 10
1  3  4  7  8  |  10
As 5 elements out of 6 are sorted then the remaining element is also in sorted. So the sorted order is -->>

1  3  4  7  8  10

so, we can say from example that there will be a for loop for passes, and there are 6 elements and 5 passes.
i.e., when n elements then there will be n-1 passes so the loop will be from 0 to n-1.
and one loop for swapping the min element with the first element of unsorted order as::
let's consider first element as min and from after that element compare each element with min if that element is less than
min then make the element as min.

therefore the logic will be as ---->>


//first take min value pos as zero
min=0
for(i=0;i<n-1;i++){  // for passes
    min=i  // consider the first element position of unsorted as min
    for(j=j+1;j<n;j++){  // check the other elements after min to find the minimum
        if(a[j]<a[min]){  // if the element is less than min element then make the element as min element
            min=j  // making the element pos as min
        }
    }
    if(min!=i){  // at starting we considered min=i so check whether that condition is false that means that i pos value is not min, so swap the element value with min value.
        swap(a[i],a[min])
    }
}
